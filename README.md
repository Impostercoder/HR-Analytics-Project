# HR-Analytics-Project
In this project we try to understand the working preference of people between Work from home (WFH) and Work from Office (WFO) and also try to find out the sick leave percentage of employees. 

We simply imported the employee data from excel and used the power bi Query Editor to load and transform data and we also made various measures using DAX such as presence count, presence %, WFH count, WFH %, SL count and SL% .
