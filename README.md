# HR-Analytics-Project
In this project we try to understand and track employee data such as working preference between Work from home (WFH) and Work from Office (WFO), attendance rate and sick leave percentage.


We simply imported the employee data from the excel file and used the power bi Query Editor to load and transform data and we also made various measures using DAX such as presence count, presence %, WFH count, WFH %, SL count and SL% .
